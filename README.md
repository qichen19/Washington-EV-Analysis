# Washington Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Project
## Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive data analysis of electric vehicle (EV) registrations in Washington State using data sourced from Kaggle. The analysis is performed using Tableau to create interactive dashboards that tell stories and answer key questions about the EV situation in Washington. The project covers several aspects of EV registrations including the total number of registered EVs, distribution by makes, a distribution map, top counties with the most EVs, EV types, trends from 2009-2023, and EV CAFV eligibility.

## Data Source
The data used in this project is sourced from Kaggle's Washington State Electric Vehicle Registration dataset. The dataset includes detailed information on EV registrations across various counties in Washington.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Tableau**: Used for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations to explore and present the data.
- **Kaggle**: Data source for the project.
- 
## Dashboards and Visualizations
- **Total Number of Registered EVs**: A summary visualization showing the total count of registered EVs in Washington.
- **EV Distribution by Makes**: A bar chart displaying the distribution of EVs by car makes, identifying the most popular makes.
- **EV Distribution Map**: A map visualization showing the distribution of EVs across different counties in Washington.
- **Top 10 Counties with the Most EVs**: A ranked list or bar chart highlighting the top 10 counties with the highest EV registrations.
- **EV Types**: Pie chart categorizing the different types of EVs registered in Washington.
- **EV Trends (2009-2023)**: A line chart showing the trend of EV registrations over the years from 2009 to 2023.
- **EV CAFV Eligibility**: A visualization assessing the number of EVs eligible for the Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) program.
## How to Use the Dashboards ##
The Tableau dashboards are interactive and allow users to explore the data by clicking on different elements to filter and drill down into more detailed views. Users can hover over data points to see additional information and use filters to customize their view. You can view the dashboards at the following links: [Dashboard 1](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lucy.chen4943/viz/WashingtonEVAnalysis_17199463482390/Dashboard1), [Dashboard 2](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lucy.chen4943/viz/WashingtonEVAnalysis-2/Dashboard2).

## Conclusion ##
This project provides valuable insights into the electric vehicle landscape in Washington State. By leveraging the power of Tableau, the visualizations created help to tell compelling stories and answer important questions about the adoption and distribution of electric vehicles in the region.
